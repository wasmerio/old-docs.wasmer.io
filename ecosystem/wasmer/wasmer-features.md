# Wasmer Features

Wasmer runtime has three different backends: Singlepass, Cranelift and LLVM. Each of those with a different tradeoff between compilation and runtime speed.

Also, Wasmer provides multiple features for their users:

* **Caching**: it allows to reuse the compiled WebAssembly code, so subsequent runs of a Wasm file will run as fast as possible
* **Metering**: it allows to track and limit the usage of functions within the host. This is also known as "gas metering"
* _WebAssembly Features_:
  * **Multi-value return**: it's a proposal that allows function to return more than one value at a time
  * **SIMD**: Single Instruction, Multiple data
* ABIs: it allows to run different programs compiled to WebAssembly, with ABIs such as:
  * **Emscripten**
  * **WASI**

### Language integration

TODO: define a set of features that are relevant and mark them here

Current ideas:

* Callbacks
* Metering
* Caching

> TODO: expand this table, it's focused on new features that we haven't implemented yet and doesn't list all language integrations
